# WordPress School Portfolio Theme

> This is a WordPress theme I made with the purpose of having a dedicated school-work portfolio. 
It´s not my prettiest work of code but I´m proud of it because it was my first personal, public domain and server set up outside school. 
Here you can find some more of my school projects.
